    <p>High school student Rakurou Hizutome has a peculiar hobby of playing poorly made games—ones that are unbalanced or are filled with so many bugs that make them borderline unplayable. The few who share his hobby might recognize him by his in-game name, Sunraku. For his next game, Rakurou is recommended Shangri-La Frontier, a popular and well-received virtual reality game as a breather from the terrible games he has been playing recently.
    <br><br>
    Once he boots up the game, Rakurou decides to sell off most of his starting gear to gain extra money, leaving himself with only a pair of boxers, a bird mask, and some weapons. He is instantly hooked as he meticulously levels up his avatar. However, after encountering some intimidating monsters, he realizes that he may have underestimated the challenge that a mainstream game can offer. As Rakurou progresses, he must draw on all the skills he has perfected from his previous gaming experience. Before long, Sunraku's eccentric playstyle takes Shangri-La Frontier by storm.

    <p>Bro the main character's name is literally sunrack. Like, a sunrack. He is also, most of the time,literally wearing a bird mask. Like, a legit bird mask. That's hilarious. Also, I like the animation a lot, the fight scenes are cool, and that one boss fight at the end of season 1 was really really hype. The lore seems to have a lot to offer too. <br><br>Really fun to watch, please give it a try!</p>
