    <h1 id="h1">Synopsis:</h1>
    <p>Kim Dok-Ja does not consider himself the protagonist of his own life. Befitting the name his parents gave him, he is a solitary person whose sole hobby is reading web novels. For over a decade, he has lived vicariously through Yu Jung-Hyeok, the main character of the web novel Three Ways to Survive the Apocalypse (TWSA).
<br><br>
Through Jung-Hyeok, Dok-Ja has experienced secondhand the trials of repeatedly regressing in time, in search of an end to life-threatening “scenarios” that force people to act out narratives for the amusement of god-like “Constellations.”
<br><br>
After reading 3,149 chapters—long after all other readers lost interest—Dok-Ja finally resigns himself to the story ending. However, he receives an enigmatic message from the author, stating that the story will soon be monetized, before his surroundings suddenly go dark.
<br><br>
He swiftly realizes that fiction has become reality and he is now living through TWSA. Although he is the singular omniscient reader of the events yet to come, his success in the scenarios is not guaranteed—but perhaps his advantage will empower him to step into the protagonist role that never suited him before.[Novelupdates]</p>

    <h1 id="h1">Personal Review:</h1>
    <p>I've really liked reading this one in novel form. Going through the journey, I've felt my hands sweating everytime I've read this. So many goosebumps-inducing moments, and the concepts are really unique. I think this is what popularized the constellation genre back then.</p>
