    <p>Yearning to make friends and perform live with a band, lonely and socially anxious Hitori "Bocchi" Gotou devotes her time to playing the guitar. On a fateful day, Bocchi meets the outgoing drummer Nijika Ijichi, who invites her to join Kessoku Band when their guitarist, Ikuyo Kita, flees before their first show. Soon after, Bocchi meets her final bandmate—the cool bassist Ryou Yamada.
    <br><br>
    Although their first performance together is subpar, the girls feel empowered by their shared love for music, and they are soon rejoined by Kita. Finding happiness in performing, Bocchi and her bandmates put their hearts into improving as musicians while making the most of their fleeting high school days. [Written by MAL Rewrite]</p>

    <p>Truly a she be like me fr fr moment. But seriously, Bocchi is really cute. The vibes are really awesome, and it's really different from this one similar show called "K-on". That anime also had highschool girls doing music, but the vibes are different. K-on for me is nostalgic, but Bocchi is really really memes. It's like it's tailored for memes, there's so much meme material. The genre is more rock too rather than the soft vibes from K-on. The main character is really funny, and it's kind of refreshing how she's shown to have pathetic thoughts at times. 
    <br><br>
    The other characters too are really awesome. I like how Ryo is typical of a broke musician, and how she's like the opposite of Bocchi even though they're both introverts. I like Nijika because she's really really cute, plays the drums, can cook, is really cheerful, and she is the one who brought Bocchi over to the band lol. Probably has a cult following by now. Kita is also really awesome, and she's a simp for Ryo but overall a very thoughful person. She's the ultimate extrovert who likes to be with people, and it's pretty funny when she gets teased about her name lol.
    <br><br>
    So yea, I like Bocchi the Rock. I like the songs too, the lyrics are edgy heheh.</p>
